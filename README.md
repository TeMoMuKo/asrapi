# AutoStop Race API

I have no idea what I am doing edition.

## Every year checklist

* Deprecate the previous version of the API
* Move views from the previous version of the API
* Check for email server credentials

## TODO

* [X] Refactor to use `decent_exposure`
* [X] Use `apipie-rails`
* [X] Use `dotenv` to store credentials
* [X] Deprecate `v1` and `v2` paths to force users to update application on Google Play
* [X] Check if everything works on iOS.
* [X] Stop Rails from logging `image` parameter in logs
* [X] See if [this](http://work.stevegrossi.com/2015/02/07/load-testing-rails-apps-with-apache-bench-siege-and-jmeter/) will work as a performance test
